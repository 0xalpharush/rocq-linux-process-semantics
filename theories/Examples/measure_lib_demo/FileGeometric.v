(** * Examples.measure_lib_demo.FileGeometric — the file-varying
      geometric family, worked

    DEMO FILE (not part of the trusted specification, and not installed).
    [MeasureLib.stdin_geometric] varies STANDARD INPUT over a fixed
    launch-time environment.  [MeasureLib.file_geometric] varies the
    CONTENTS OF ONE FILE instead, at a path the task names, over a fixed
    argv, environment, standard input and base file system.  This file
    instantiates it and carries it through to a
    [Measure.weight_bound_T].

    ** Why a task reaches for this one rather than the standard-input one

    A program that takes its input as a path argument reads nothing from
    standard input, so a distribution that varies standard input puts all
    its mass on a coordinate the program never looks at, and every
    classifier either rejects all of it or none of it.  The file family
    varies the coordinate the program actually reads.  What it costs is
    one obligation that has no counterpart in the standard-input family,
    and this file pays it the way the library recommends.

    ** The argv/path coupling, discharged by construction

    [MeasureLib.file_geometric] takes argv and the path as INDEPENDENT
    parameters, and passing two different paths yields a distribution
    that is healthy by every certificate and varies a file the program
    never opens.  [MeasureLib.file_geometric_argv1] is the derived
    constructor for the shape a driver actually has — a program name and
    the input path at argv[1] — and it takes the path ONCE, so the
    mismatch is not expressible.  This file uses it, and
    [file_demo_argv_names_path] is the receipt.

    [file_demo_misconfiguration_is_invisible] is the other half: the
    library's pin of what a mismatched instance looks like, instantiated
    at this file's stop weight.  A reader can see there that the
    misconfigured instance passes both certificates and still collapses.

    ** The file system, and what [MeasureLib.fs_file] reads

    A core carries a whole [Fs.Fs], and the family varies one path of it
    over a fixed base: [MeasureLib.file_core] is
    [Fs.fs_set] of the contents into the base, and
    [MeasureLib.fs_file] is the readback, total by returning [[]] at an
    absent path.  [MeasureLib.file_core_inj] — the injectivity of that
    embedding — is what the duplicate-freedom argument below spends, and
    it is the reason two cores differing only in the file's contents are
    distinct cores rather than the same one.

    Nothing exhibited here is claimed VALID and nothing is claimed
    rejected by any classifier. *)

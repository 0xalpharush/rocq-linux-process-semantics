(** * Examples.measure_lib_demo.EnvpGeometric — the environment-varying
      geometric family, worked

    DEMO FILE (not part of the trusted specification, and not installed).
    [MeasureLib]'s worked demonstration instantiates
    [MeasureLib.stdin_geometric], which holds argv, envp and the file
    system FIXED and varies standard input alone.  This file instantiates
    its two-coordinate companion [MeasureLib.stdin_envp_geometric], which
    varies the launch-time ENVIRONMENT as well, and carries it through to
    a [Measure.weight_bound_T].

    ** The three parameters, and why a task has three rather than one

    [p_stop] is the per-byte stop weight on standard input, as before.
    The environment coordinate needs two more, because an environment is
    a list of byte STRINGS and both the number of entries and the length
    of each has to be paid for: [r] is the weight of stopping after an
    entry (so [1 # 4] means a mean of four entries) and [q_e] is the
    per-byte stop weight WITHIN an entry.  [MeasureLib.envp_factor] is
    the running product of the two and [MeasureLib.envp_point] is [r]
    times it, which is what makes the two coordinates multiply in
    [MeasureLib.stdin_envp_geometric_cylinder_mass].

    The numbers here are [p_stop = 1 # 8], [r = 1 # 4], [q_e = 1 # 16],
    and the environment prefix the fire set is charged against is ONE
    entry of ONE byte.  A realistic `NAME=value` entry is a dozen bytes
    and the ceiling is then a rational with a forty-digit denominator; a
    one-byte entry keeps the ceiling at [315 # 536870912], which a
    reader can multiply out by hand from the four factors
    [envp_fire_ceiling] names.  Nothing in the argument depends on the
    length.

    ** What the cylinder is here

    Two existentials rather than one: a core is in the cylinder over
    [(es, bs)] when its environment EXTENDS [es] and its standard input
    EXTENDS [bs], with argv and the file system fixed.  So the fire set
    below contains cores at every environment depth and every input
    length past the two prefixes, not merely the two records
    [envp_fire_list] exhibits — which is what makes the slack in
    [envp_fire_slack] large rather than a rounding.

    ** Non-vacuity

    [envp_fire_slack] pins that the two records really are inside the
    cylinder and weigh strictly less than the ceiling, so the bound is
    not attained; [envp_off_argv_weighs_nothing] pins the other side,
    that the family is not a constant — a core whose argv is not the
    fixed one weighs exactly zero.  Neither record is claimed VALID and
    neither is claimed rejected by any classifier. *)

    the empty pair for one, one entry and one byte for the other.  The
    third says the list is admissible, so [envp_fire_bound] applies to
    it.  The fourth is the strictness: the two records weigh strictly
    less than the ceiling, so this route carries slack.

    All of that slack is the cylinder's other members — every
    environment past [V] and every input past the NUL byte, at every

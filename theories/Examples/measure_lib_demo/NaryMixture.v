(** * Examples.measure_lib_demo.NaryMixture — the n-ary mixture, worked

    DEMO FILE (not part of the trusted specification, and not installed:
    see `theories/Examples/dune`).  [MeasureLib]'s worked demonstration
    assembles a distribution out of [MeasureLib.finite_support],
    [MeasureLib.cd_scale] and [MeasureLib.cd_mix2].  It never reaches the
    [n]-ARY mixture, and this file is that instantiation: the three
    combinators [MeasureLib.cd_mix], [MeasureLib.cd_zero] and
    [MeasureLib.cd_sum_over], carried through to a
    [Measure.weight_bound_T] a task could ship.

    ** The shape, and why an [n]-ary mixture is the natural one for it

    A task whose inputs fall into named CLASSES declares one
    component per class and mixes them.  Two classes are [cd_mix2]; three
    or more are a list, and writing a list of three as two nested
    [cd_mix2]s means writing the associativity by hand at every bound.
    The three classes here are read off the first byte of standard
    input — plain text, NUL-led, carriage-return-led — with a quarter of
    the space's mass carried by the class that has no leading control
    byte.

    ** What the [n]-ary bound asks for, and what it gives back

    [MeasureLib.cd_mix_bound] takes a bound FUNCTION [B :
    CoreDistribution -> Q] rather than a list of numbers, so the per-
    component ceilings have to be expressible as a function of the
    component.  That is not a restriction in practice and this file is
    the demonstration of why: the natural statement of a fire set that
    takes a fixed FRACTION of each class is exactly such a function,
    [fun D => (1 # 4) * cd_mass D], and the resulting total is a quarter
    of the mixture's own declared mass by [MeasureLib.cd_mix_mass]
    ([nary_ceiling_is_a_quarter_of_the_mass]).  A task whose per-class
    ceilings are unrelated numbers would instead reach for
    [MeasureLib.cd_mix2] twice; the two are the same object
    ([MeasureLib.cd_mix_nary_agrees]), so nothing is lost either way.

    ** Non-vacuity

    [nary_ceiling_is_attained_and_bites] closes both directions.  The
    fire set's own three records weigh EXACTLY the ceiling, so the bound
    is tight rather than slack — unlike the geometric routes, where the
    mass is a supremum and never attained.  And three records OUTSIDE the
    fire set weigh strictly more than the ceiling, so the fire-set
    hypothesis in [nary_weight_bound_T_of] is load-bearing: drop it and
    the conclusion is false at this multiplier.

    As everywhere in [MeasureLib], the records exhibited here are not
    claimed VALID ([FinInput.valid_fin_input]) and not claimed rejected
    by any classifier.  Exhibiting them is arithmetic. *)

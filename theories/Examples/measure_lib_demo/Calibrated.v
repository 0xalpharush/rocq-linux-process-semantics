(** * Examples.measure_lib_demo.Calibrated — the calibrated mixture,
      worked

    DEMO FILE (not part of the trusted specification, and not installed).
    [MeasureLib.calibrated_mixture] is the composition the library was
    requested for: fifteen sixteenths of the mass on standard input over
    ONE fixed launch-time environment, and a sixteenth spread over
    environments as well, at [r = 1 # 5] entries and [q_e = 1 # 33] bytes
    per entry.  It is [MeasureLib.cd_scale] twice and
    [MeasureLib.cd_mix2] once and no new combinator, which is the point
    of it having a name.  This file instantiates it at one stop weight
    and carries it to a [Measure.weight_bound_T].

    ** Why the ceiling comes out as the cylinder's own mass

    The fire set below lies in the fixed environment: every core in it
    has the canonical environment exactly, and a standard input
    extending one NUL byte.  Both components then charge it the same
    number — the stdin-only component through its cylinder, the
    envp-varying component through its cylinder over the EMPTY
    environment prefix, whose environment factor is [1].  The two are
    then scaled by shares that sum to [1], so the mixture's ceiling is
    the cylinder mass itself, [7 # 2048].

    That is worth writing down rather than deriving in the reader's
    head, because it is the property a task actually wants from a
    calibrated mixture: mixing in an environment-varying component costs
    NOTHING on fire sets that do not vary the environment.  A fire set
    that does vary it pays, and pays through the second component's
    environment factor.

    ** What the mixture does buy, and where

    [calib_envp_component_carries_mass] is the bite:
    [MeasureLib.calibrated_mixture_envp_bites] instantiated here, showing
    a core with a non-empty environment that the stdin-only component
    weighs at ZERO and the mixture weighs positively.  Without that, the
    sixteenth would be decoration — the whole reason to mix is that the
    envp-varying component reaches cores the other one cannot see.

    Nothing exhibited here is claimed VALID and nothing is claimed
    rejected by any classifier. *)

(** The task's canonical launch-time environment.  It is what the

(** THE CEILING, as the two component ceilings scaled and added, stated
    as a [Qeq] before it is used so that the number in the demonstrations
    is visibly what the composition yields.  The second component is
    charged its cylinder over the EMPTY environment prefix — the
    fire set fixes an environment rather than a prefix of one, and the
    empty prefix is the one every environment extends. *)

(** THE BOUND.  One [MeasureLib.cd_mix2_bound], one

    bound under each — the same four-step shape [MeasureLib]'s worked
    demonstration uses, at a mixture whose components are both geometric
    rather than one finite and one geometric.

    The two side conditions are where the fire set is spent.  For the
    stdin-only component: a fire core is the canonical environment
    followed by an extension of [[0]].  For the envp-varying component:
    the same core, read as an environment extending the empty prefix and
    a standard input extending [[0]] — so the environment existential is
    discharged with the canonical environment itself. *)

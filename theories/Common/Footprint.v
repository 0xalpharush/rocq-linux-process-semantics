(** * Common.Footprint — concrete address regions and their disjointness.

    EXPLORATION / PROTOTYPE.

    This is the SHARED VOCABULARY for "these two memory accesses cannot
    interfere".  It is deliberately tiny, deliberately CONCRETE (a region
    is a pair of [Z] bounds on [bv_unsigned], not a symbolic expression),
    and deliberately independent of [Common.SymExec]: the reflective
    executor discharges its cross-base [SCDisjoint] obligations through
    it, and a Hoare-style frame rule can use exactly the same [region] /
    [rg_disj] pair for its separating conjunction, without either
    importing the other.

    THE INTERFACE, in three lines:

    - [region] = a half-open byte interval [[rg_lo, rg_hi)] of the 64-bit
      address space, with [rg_lo <= rg_hi] and [0 <= rg_lo],
      [rg_hi <= 2^64] carried as the well-formedness predicate [rg_wf];
    - [covers r a n] = "the [n] bytes at address [a] lie inside [r]";
    - [rg_disj r1 r2] = "[r1] and [r2] do not overlap".

    Everything else is one [lia].  The point is not the theory (there is
    none) but that a per-binary proof states its memory layout ONCE, as a
    handful of [region]s with pairwise [rg_disj] facts, instead of
    re-deriving an address inequality at every load.

    The three regions every one of the examples has are built here:
    [stack_rg] (the [rsp - K .. rsp] frame window), [seg_rg] (a writable
    ELF segment: .data/.sbss/.bss), and [heap_rg] (a brk/mmap grant
    [[base, cur)]).  A bump allocator moving [cur] keeps the SAME region
    name with a larger [rg_hi]: [covers] is monotone in the region
    ([covers_mono]), so nothing downstream re-proves. *)
